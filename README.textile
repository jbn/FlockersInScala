h1. Flockers In Scala

This is an implementation of a boids-like flocking simulation, written
as part of "a tutorial demonstrating the use of MASON from Scala":http://pathdependent.com/computational_social_sciences/using-mason-from-scala/.

h2. Running

If you are not interested in the tutorial or prefer to read the code first,
you may run setup and run this project by running:

<pre><code>git clone git://github.com/jbn/FlockersInScala.git
cd FlockersInScala/
./setup_mason.sh
sbt run
</code></pre>

You will be asked to select which executable (main class) to run. For the 
Simulation with GUI, select <tt>com.pathdependent.flockers.FlockersWithUI</tt>.
